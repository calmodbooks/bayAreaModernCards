An excellent example of organic modernism, both exterior and interior spaces are characterized by spiral ramps, decorative arches and spheres.</p></div><img src="http://calmodbooks.github.io/bayAreaModernCards/assets/img/cards/sjpa.png"/></div><div id="card2" class="card-vert"><div class="caption standard"><p>San Francisco’s iconic <span>Transamerica Pyramid </span>stands an impressive 853 feet.

To minimize excavation, architect Beverley David Thorne utilized an innovative design that offsets the main living area from the carport/entry way.  All the major rooms of the home, with the exception of the kitchen, breakfast room, and foyer, offer panoramic views.</p></div><img src="http://calmodbooks.github.io/bayAreaModernCards/assets/img/cards/caseStudyHouse.png"/></div><div id="card6" class="card-vert"><div class="caption standard"><p>San Jose’s award-winning <span>IBM campus</span>, designed by architect John Savage Bolles, opened in 1958.
