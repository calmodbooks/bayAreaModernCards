        p Built on a sloping hill in Marin County, #[span Case Study #26 (1962 – 1963)] is Northern California’s only Case Study house.  To minimize excavation, architect Beverley David Thorne utilized an innovative design that offsets the main living area from the carport/entry way.  All the major rooms of the home, with the exception of the kitchen, breakfast room, and foyer, offer panoramic views.
