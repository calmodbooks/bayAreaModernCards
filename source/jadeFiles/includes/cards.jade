        p Distinctive in design, the #[span San Jose Center for the Performing Arts (1972)] represents an architectural “who’s who” of some of the brightest minds of Taliesin Associates, Frank Lloyd Wright’s atelier.  An excellent example of organic modernism, both exterior and interior spaces are characterized by spiral ramps, decorative arches and spheres.

        p San Francisco’s iconic #[span Transamerica Pyramid ]stands an impressive 853 feet.  Designed by architect William Pereira, the idea behind the building’s shape was to allow for natural light to hit the city streets below. The building, which is covered in white quartz, dates to 1972.

        p Built on a sloping hill in Marin County, #[span Case Study #26 (1962 – 1963)] is Northern California’s only Case Study house.  To minimize excavation, architect Beverley David Thorne utilized an innovative design that offsets the main living area from the carport/entry way.  All the major rooms of the home, with the exception of the kitchen, breakfast room, and foyer, offer panoramic views.
